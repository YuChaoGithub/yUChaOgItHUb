I am interested in application development (e.g. web/game/mobile dev), database systems, and distributed systems.

**Software Projects:**

* Web: [YARC](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/YARC).
* Games: [Knights Rubbish](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/Knights-Rubbish), [kQq](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/kqq).
* Mobile Apps: [Free Diving Apnea Training](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/flutter-apnea-app), [Music Training](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/music-training), [Recordable Soundpad](https://github.com/YuChaoGithub/recordable-launchpad).

I also enjoy drawing, writing, and creating [random stuff](https://shinerightstudio.com/projects/).
